/**********
 * Arduino 3d printer enclosure environmental control
 * I needed to build an enclosure for my 3D printers, and as it was going to be in a pretty cold room,
 * I needed to create some environmental control to heat it up, but also to cool it down.
 * The purpose is to keep the temperature inside the enclosure at a constant 21C.
 * In order to do so, several fans will be used:
 * 1. Heating fan
 * 2. Cooling fan
 * 3. Exhaust fan
 * 
 * All those fans will be controlled by an Arduino.
 * Some temperature sensors will also be used to start and stop the fans when the required temperature
 * is correct inside the enclosure.
